This is excellent work overall. Your discussion of the questions (in words and code) is complete and even goes beyond the requested analysis. There is a minor thing that didn’t work out quite right: Your power law uses the wrong exponent - the outcome distribution should have exponent 2, but in order to achieve that, you need to tell rd.power an exponent of 3.

This is excellent work overall. Your discussion of the questions (in words and code) is complete and demonstrates a very good, detailed understanding of the material.There is a minor thing that didn’t work out quite right: For the final part, the 68% confidence interval should have been estimated from the chain data directly - the standard deviation equation only works for Gaussian distributions, which you have not formally proven to be valid for the output data.
