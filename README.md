This is excellent work overall. Your discussion of the questions (in words and code) is complete and even goes beyond the requested analysis. There is a minor thing that didnâ€™t work out quite right: Your power law uses the wrong exponent - the outcome distribution should have exponent 2, but in order to achieve that, you need to tell rd.power an exponent of 3.
